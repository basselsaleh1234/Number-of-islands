In a 2D map with water (marked by 0) and land (marked by 1). Connected land parts are forming an island. Your algorithm should take such a map and return the number of islands. 
In this Stage you should try to create a sample map to make sure you understood the task.


Create a sample map and save it to the variable input.
Your map should have 4 rows.
Your map should have 3 columns per row.
Every row should have at least one column with land (marked with the char '1' ).
